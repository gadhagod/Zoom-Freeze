# Zoom Freeze
A super simple to use tool that freezes yourself on other's Zoom.

## Why?
We have all been there. You have been called on by your teacher or boss, and you were off daydreaming about something better than being in a boring meeting. You are forced to answer something dumb, and everyone instantly knows your head was in the clouds.

Now, you no longer have to suffer! With <i>Zoom Freeze</i>, you can instantly make your video streaming stop on other's devices. People will think, "oh no, poor guy. His big presentation has been messed up by his horrible internet!". No one will know what really happened!

**Note**: This only works on macs.

## Installation
Something something.

## Usage
Click on the application icon in your finder. No window will open up, but the application will be activated. 
After joining a meeting, hit <kbd>control</kbd> and <kbd>J</kbd>. This will freeze your zoom. To unfreeze it, just hit the same keys.
